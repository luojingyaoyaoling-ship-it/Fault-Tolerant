# Fault-Tolerant
Workload-aware Approximate Fault-tolerance for Stream Processing (WAFP) 
Official implementation of *"Workload-aware Approximate Backup to Reduce Fault-tolerant Overhead for Stream Processing Applications"* (FGCS 2025).   
Contains the WAFP-SF / WAFP-CF algorithms, D-WAFP dynamic adaptor, and the Stateflow-based simulator used in the paper.   
Clone, build, and reproduce the throughput / latency / recovery-time numbers in one command.
